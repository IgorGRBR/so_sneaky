#Enemy tag:
#Each enemy has to start with 3 different properties: initial direction, preferred direction and walking strategy
#Initial direction - the direction the enemy starts with at the beginning of the level: 0 - up, 1 - right, 2 - down, 3 - left
#Preferred direction - the direction the enemy prefers to turn towards/wall to walk along: 0 - up (just stops when hit a wall), 1 - right, 2 - down (bounces back when hit a wall), 3 - left
#Walking strategy - the pattern of walking the enemy uses: 0 and 3 - random walking, 1 - hugging a wall, 2 - lazy turning
#Each of these properties are represented with a single 6 bit number, calculated by the following formula: walking strategy + 4 * initial direction + 16 * preferred direction
